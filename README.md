Illustrate

/app/src/ - The express app src
/app/src/lobby/ - The public directory for the lobby app
/app/src/player - The public directory for the player's app
/app/src/judge - The public directory for the judge's app

Things that need to be done
  1) Create missing app directories
  2) Sort current React UI's to correct directories
  3) Add static routes for /lobby, /player, /judge
  4) Add router to apps!
